Install Atom Editor
Search and Install the jsondb-atom-plugin plugin
Activate the Plugin by selecting the Menu: Packages > json-atom-plugin > Toggle this will add a extra sub pane to the right.
Select the Jsondb text file you want to edit, and click on a line. The right pane will attempt to parse the line on which you have the cursor, if its a valid JSON it will show it in the right pane in a pretty indented form.
WIP: As of now the right pane is read only any changes made to it do not reflect back in the main document
